# UFOs
# Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a webpage and dynamic table using html and java-script including the in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing user to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, user can add table filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
Visitors will be greeted by the webpage with the clean title and followed by a filter and table. These filters will be used to create a table with the users desired city, state, country, and shape. To filter the data, users will need to type the information they require in the text box. This will allow the webpage to dynamically create and update the table by users’ desires. 
The image below shows only by filtered date and city. The other results automatically gets filtered by given data.

The image below shows full filtered search. Users can easily clear the information by removing their filtered search from the text box.

# Summary: 

The one drawback of this new design could be the filter search. The user can put in any information that they desire which can cause the information to display incorrectly. The input text has already provided so that it will help users with the format of the filter search. To make sure the information is displayed correctly we could add different methods in formatting. 

# Recommendations: 

To further develop this webpage, we could add the filtered date table from which the users can pick a date from and date to. In this table, it allows them to filter to only 1 date. This can allow them to search from a specific date from and to. For example: users would like the search result from 1/10/2010 – 04/10/2010. 

Second recommendation to further develop this webpage is to add the filters to the state, city, country, and shape using a drop-down menu. It will make it easier for users to pick the state, city, country, or shape by just selecting it from the drop-down menu or list.
